# Threat Hunting and Forensic Analysis Toolkit

## 📌 Overview

The Threat Hunting and Forensic Analysis Toolkit is a Python-based security investigation application designed to simulate core Security Operations Center (SOC) and digital forensic activities.

This toolkit analyzes system log files, detects Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), identifies brute-force login attempts, scans suspicious processes, calculates risk scores, and generates structured forensic reports in CSV, JSON, and graphical formats.

The project demonstrates practical threat detection logic, structured incident reporting, and modular security design principles.
